Dice Rolling Simulation in Java
This project simulates the rolling of two dice using object-oriented programming principles in Java. It includes the creation of two classes: Die and Dice, which handle the behavior of individual dice and the combination of two dice, respectively.

Key Features:
Die Class:

Implements a 6-sided die with methods to roll the die and get/set its face value.
Includes a no-argument constructor that initializes the dieâ€™s face value to 1.
Randomly generates face values between 1 and 6 upon rolling.
Dice Class:

Holds two Die objects as instance variables.
Rolls both dice and calculates their sum.
Method to retrieve the total face value of the dice.
Additional Functionality:
Rolls the dice 1000 times and stores the occurrence of each sum (ranging from 2 to 12) in an array.
Prints a frequency table of the results.
Outputs a histogram that visually represents the frequency of each possible sum.
This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as classes, methods, constructors, and random number generation, while also working with arrays and loops for data collection and visualization.
